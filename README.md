# Cloud Security Journey 🛡️

## About This Repository

This is my documented journey from coding beginner to cloud security professional. I'm using local AI models to deeply understand security concepts, not just memorize commands.

## Why I'm Doing This

- **Goal**: Land a cloud security role
- **Approach**: Understanding the "why" behind every concept
- **Method**: AI-assisted learning with local models (no API costs)
- **Focus**: AWS, Azure, GCP security + automation

## My Setup

### Hardware
- **GPU**: AMD Radeon 9700XT (16GB VRAM)
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **Storage**: 1TB

### AI Models Used
- **Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-Q6_K** - Primary learning model
- **DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-16B** - Code understanding and explanation
- **Tool**: LM Studio (local AI runtime)

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Current)
- [ ] Setting up local AI environment
- [ ] Understanding cloud security basics
- [ ] Learning to read and write basic security scripts

### Phase 2: Deep Dive
- [ ] AWS IAM and access management
- [ ] Network security (VPCs, Security Groups)
- [ ] Cloud automation with Terraform
- [ ] Security monitoring and logging

### Phase 3: Practical Application
- [ ] Build security automation scripts
- [ ] Create lab environments
- [ ] Practice incident response scenarios
